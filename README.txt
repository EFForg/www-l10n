This repository contains translation requests for content from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation's website at https://www.eff.org/

Translation requests are made available in XML Localisation Interchange
File Format (XLIFF): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF

We have created a directory for each language for which we are currently
requesting translations.  In each directory you can find the XLIFF
translation requests generated by our website.

To help translate, we ask that you fork this repository, create a branch
for your work, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.
Alternately you can e-mail a translated XLIFF file to translate@eff.org.

For HTML content from our website, the XLIFF files contain special
markup (such as <bpt> and <ept> tags) escaping the HTML tags.  When
importing your translation, our system automatically replaces this XLIFF
markup with the original HTML markup.  It's important that you preserve
the XLIFF markup as-is when editing and exporting your translation.
Otherwise we will see a "failed to validate semantic integrity" warning
and importing your translation will be a more manual process.

XLIFF Editor: Virtaal
=====================

Virtaal is a free/libre open source software (FLOSS) computer-assisted
translation tool written in Python: http://virtaal.translatehouse.org/
On Debian-based Linux distributions you can install it easily via:
apt-get install virtaal

When translating with Virtaal, open an XLIFF file, click on a blank
target field, and then click Edit > Transfer from Source (Alt+Down).
This will preserve the XLIFF markup tags in your translation.  Save your
work and commit the XLIFF file to your repository.

XLIFF Editor: Memsource
=======================

Memsource is a commercial software-as-a-service computer-assisted
translation tool: https://www.memsource.com/  You can register as an
amateur translator and use a free trial version of Memsource, with a
maximum of two files being translated at any one time.

Login to your Memsource account and create a new project with source
language English, and set the Target language to the language of the
translation request you are working on.  Then create a new job.  Import
the XLIFF file, and under the options, select XLIFF as the File Type of
the file you are uploading.

You can now click on the job file to work on your translation.  For each
string, click Edit > Copy Source to Target (Ctrl+Insert).  This will
preserve the XLIFF markup tags in your translation.

When you are done, go back to the project page, click the checkbox next
to your job, click Download, and click Completed File.  The resulting
XLIFF file can be committed to your www-l10n repository.
